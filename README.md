## About Modern WordPress Website

Modern WordPress Website (MWW) is a modern way of building WordPress websites.<br/>
Simple and powerful, it's a great skeleton to bootstrap a new WordPress project.

- MVC in WordPress.
- Simple route engine with native WordPress functions.
- Modern, yet simple PHP.
- PSR-4 Autoloading.
- Integrated with Acceptance, Functional, Integration and Unit tests (Thanks to Luca Tume, from wp-browser)
- Installs as a *mu-plugin*

Modern WordPress Website (MWW) is great for experienced PHP developers using WordPress, and for intermediate developers who want to take their skills to the next level.

MWW is in beta and open to contributors. Help us test and develop it!

## Installation

*Modern WordPress Website* is installed as a mu-plugin. This way we intercept WordPress requests at an earlier stage and have more control over the application.

To get started, simply follow these steps in a clean WordPress installation:

- Run `git clone https://github.com/Luc45/ModernWordPressWebsite wp-content/mu-plugins` in the root folder of a clean WordPress installation
- Run `composer update` in **wp-content/mu-plugins/mww/**
- (Recommended) You will not need your theme anymore, you can create an empty theme with just index.php, style.css and functions.php. [Download empty theme](https://github.com/Luc45/EmptyTheme/archive/master.zip).
- (Recommended) Set up tests by editing .env.example and renaming it to .env - Run tests with `vendor/bin/codecept run`

Now it's up to you to create awesome stuff!

## How it works

Even though MWW is powerful, it's also very simple. It all starts with the routes:

```php
// routes/conditional.php
$router->add('is_front_page', ['App\Pages\Home', 'index']);
```

If is_front_page() is true, then call method index on App\Pages\Home:

```php
// app/pages/Home.php
class Home extends Page
{
    public function index()
    {
        $this->template->include('header');
        $this->template->include('pages.home');
        $this->template->include('footer');
    }
}
```

Here, we are including the header, the home page content and the footer using [template_include](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Filter_Reference/template_include) in the background.

That's all we need to get started!

Of course that modern applications uses a lot of dynamic data, not only static views. Here's how we can show Posts on the Home page:

```php
// app/pages/Home.php
class Home extends Page
{
    public function index()
    {
        $this->template->include('header');
        $this->template->include('pages.home', [
            'posts' => get_posts()
        ]);
        $this->template->include('footer');
    }
}
```
Then, we have a variable `$posts` in our home view with the content of `get_posts()`:
```php
// views/pages/home.php
foreach ($posts as $post) {
    echo $post->post_title;
}
```

You see? This is MVC. We could easily separate the logic - we don't need to use get_posts() in our view, we can do it in the Controller (or create a model for it) and pass it digested to the view. This way, it is easier for our application to grow organized.
