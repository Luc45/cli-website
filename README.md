## Code is Poetry

This is the public repository for my CLI website, hosted at [https://www.lucasbustamante.com.br/cli/](https://www.lucasbustamante.com.br/cli/).

It uses [Modern WordPress Website (MWW)](https://github.com/Luc45/ModernWordPressWebsite).

Want to replicate it?

- Install a Clean WordPress somewhere
- Remove all plugins and themes
- Install [Empty theme](https://github.com/Luc45/EmptyTheme/archive/master.zip)
- Run `git clone https://github.com/Luc45/cli-website wp-content/mu-plugins` on the root folder of the WordPress installation.
