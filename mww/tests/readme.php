/**
 * Modern WordPress Website uses lucatume/wp-browser for testing.
 *
 * lucatume/wp-browser is a set of extensions for Codeception, with a lot of useful methods for testing WordPress
 * It can run acceptance, functional, integration and unit tests.
 *
 * Codeception is built on top of PHPUnit, so in fact, we have this as testing framework:
 * PHPUnit + Codeception + lucatume/wp-browser
 *
 * To learn how to test, you should learn PHPUnit, then Codeception, then lucatume/wp-browser,
 * then everything will make sense, since one just extends the other.
 *
 * To run your tests edit mu-plugins/mww/.env.example and rename it to .env
 * Then, run "codecept run functional"
 *
 * To learn how to write your own tests, see lucatume/wp-browser documentation:
 * https://github.com/lucatume/wp-browser
